### Quantized-Elastic Spacetime Model: 

1. Basic Sets of the model
1 Basic set:

1.1 The universe is expanding.

1.2 The universe operates under the Law of Energy Conservation and the Law of Entropy Increase.

1.3 The universe consists of Space Elementary Quanta (SEQ), discrete Planck-scale units, forming a topologically homeomorphic 3D structure (adjacency relations remain preserved while individual SEQ energy states may vary). Importantly, this polycrystalline structure necessarily contains primordial Periodic or Random Topological Dislocation to ensure physical isotropy, yet maintains strict 3D topological homeomorphism as these defects are cosmologically frozen and adjacency-preserving since the birth of the universe. The distortion of light around black holes demonstrates that gravitational and electromagnetic field quanta are coupled, suggesting they originate from the same quantum field in different excited states—leading to the SEQ hypothesis. The spacing and tension between adjacent SEQ can be modulated by gravitational or equivalent gravitational fields.

1.4 All field quanta and elementary particles represent different energy excitation states of SEQ, expressible as 3D dynamic structural matrices of SEQ .

1.5 SEQ possess a ground state energy (e.g., ground-state spin or vibration modes). If ground-state spin chirality is fixed, this may explain parity violation. The ground-state energy of SEQ could also account for the cosmological constant in General Relativity. This framework shows strong alignment with Loop Quantum Gravity theory.

1.6 Adjacent SEQ maintain a dynamic equilibrium spacing interconnected via spring-like bonds in their ground state. SEQ are fundamental, indivisible Planck-scale entities—their structure remains intact under any deformation or energy fluctuations.

1.6.1 The sub-Planckian regime governs the spatial elasticity of the network (including elastic potential storage and release), while quantized energy transfer occurs exclusively through interactions between SEQ. Within this framework:

1.6.2 The spin degrees of freedom of SEQ and their elastic bonds remain decoupled, preserving independent dynamical regimes.

1.6.3 Under perturbation, the system responds by modifying SEQ resonant frequencies while generating compressive/tensile forces.

1.6.4 This elastic response is nonlinear and asymmetric.

1.6.5 SEQ are stable, indivisible structures composed of sub-Planckian components. SEQ’ spin emerges from collective space transformations at the sub-Planck level. This ensures the spin degrees of freedom do not interfere with elastic deformations in the SEQ network. This architecture naturally protects spin dynamics from elastic disturbances.

1.6.6 At the sub-Planckian scale, the elastic properties of the underlying substrate impose an upper bound on the spacing modulation and tension between adjacent SEQ. This fundamental limit ensures that extreme deformations (e.g., near black hole singularities) cannot disrupt the topological integrity of the SEQ network.

1.6.7 In this model, the harmonic oscillation intervals of SEQ are integer multiples of Planck time(tₚ). Consequently, all dynamic processes—including elastic strain interactions, harmonic conduction, as well as scalar, spinor field transmissions and other energy conduction mode induced by rotational axis dynamics—are fundamentally constrained by the discrete Planck-time intervals. This property inherently ensures the model's consistency with the discrete-time hypothesis in quantum mechanics and quantum gravity theories.

1.7 If matter truly traversed space, it would require modification of spacetime's adjacency relations. Yet black holes—despite their extreme mass—preserve local spacetime topology (as evidenced by smooth light bending). This implies that apparent particle motion must instead represent propagating excitations of spacetime itself, consistent with GR. The speed of light (c) constitutes the maximum excitation propagation rate in space.
